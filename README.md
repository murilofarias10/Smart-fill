# Smart Fill: AI-Powered Fill-in-the-Blank Quiz Generator

🎯 Purpose and Description
This project was created as my final delivery for the Microsoft AI Agents Hackathon, showcasing how AI can be used to create dynamic and educational experiences. Smart Fill AI-Powered Fill-in-the-Blank Quiz Generator is an interactive game designed to generate engaging "fill-in-the-blank".
Users simply upload a file, and the app uses an AI agent (powered by Azure and Mistral models) to offer constructive feedback.

⚙️ How It Works

Users simply upload a file, and the app uses an AI agent (powered by Azure and Mistral models) to offer constructive feedback.

The AI agent in Smart Fill acts as an expert reviewer. After a user uploads a document, the fill-in-the-blank quiz questions are generated by custom logic within the app, while the AI agent focuses on delivering high-quality, context-aware feedback

This automation streamlines the creation of educational resources and enhances the learning experience for both educators and students.
